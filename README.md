<h2>GameHub</h2>

GameHub is a project that I developed during my first year of studies for my B.S.C. degree as part of an OOP course. 

The GameHub is a place to play several games in either single or multiplayer mode. 

**Single-player games included in the GameHub are:**
- Guess My Number: 
  The player needs to guess the number that the computer picks while the computer response with indication if the actual pick is greater or lower than the user input.
- Rock Paper Scissors: The classic game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

**Multiplayer games included in the GameHub are:**
- Tic Tac Toe: Classic Tick-Tac-Toe we all know and love
- Four in a Row: Classic Four-In-A-Row. You already know what it is :P

**GameHub features include:**
- Player names
- Each game can have more than one instance simultanitly at the same time
